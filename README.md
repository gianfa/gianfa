### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in synthesizing R&D best practices through CI/CD and science library development.. Previously I worked in recommendation systems
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Causality and Graph Theory analysis
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Cognitive systems projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Deep Learning projects, ML web app prototyping, Python programming
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: gian.angelini@hotmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I use to have remote study sessions around the world, speaking english. Sometimes I have to wake up too early in the morning and I end up being so dizzy that I confuse some words, completely changing the meaning of the sentence, before to realize my mistake ðŸ˜‚.
